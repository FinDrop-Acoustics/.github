# FishEye Collaborative Hardware and Software Management
Leveraging the power of emergent underwater listening technologies to advance our understanding of coral reef ecosystems and near-shore fisheries. Our work aims to improve sustainable management decisions for fisheries and biodiverse ecosystems and bolster local blue economies through research, education, and capacity building.

## History
FishEye Collaborative’s conservation efforts started within FishEye Acoustics LLC, a marine technology company developing an entirely new category of marine sensors. We recognized that this technology could be used to fill a critical gap in our knowledge of marine soundscapes, enabling Passive Acoustic Monitoring to become a much more powerful tool across a broad array of biodiverse habitats, starting with coral reefs. FishEye Collaborative was formed in Fall 2023 to pursue this mission-oriented work.

## Field Studies
We are developing our technical approach at the Curaçao Sea Aquarium research station and in association with nearby SubStation Curaçao. These sister institutions on the east side of Willemstad offer world-class facilities for coral reef research and easy access to well-conserved reefs with significant mesophotic habitat. We thank the Sea Aquarium for its support and look forward to years of collaboration.
